	Wo pehli date thi life ki aur tum perfect date thi. Unn lamho ko yaar karta hu to aaj bhi labho pe hasi aa jaati hai. Kya hua karta tha mai, aur wo sab dekhte hue bhi you came to meet me every single time, proposed me and made me believe in love. Now we look back, it seems like we are meant to be together.<br>
	<center>Love for street food ho ya random walks on street under the moon, we both love it. &#128516;<br></center>
	<center>Food order in karke binge watch karne mai no one can beat us, bas bahar jaane mai aalsi lagta hai. &#128517;<br></center>
	<center>Political Discussion ho to view always ready, Watching Flying beast is everyday ritual &#129313;</center><br>

We had our ups and downs.., currently having one (asshole me) &#128528; there were nights we cried.., and there were days where we need each other company. <br>There were moment in which all we need is tight hug. But whenever we met, it feels like nothing happend, like hum to kabhi dur the hi nahi..., jaise tum hamesha meri baahon mai hi to thi. Bas yahi chahiye zindagi se.., this never ending pyaar and care for each other. And to always stand besides you <b>MunMun</b>.<br><br> Yes sometimes I irritates you, but <b>I LOVE YOU</b> so much much much, beyond my imagination. You are my baby, the love of my life, the person which motivates me, guide me, make me push my limits. Please forgive me for my behavior and once again <b>Happy Anniversary LOVE ❤️</b>.
